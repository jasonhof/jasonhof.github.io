I am researching creative solutions for increasing access to healthcare at the intersection of computer science and biology.

I am advised by Dr. [Shwetak Patel](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/) in the [Ubiquitous Computing Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/) in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/).  You might also be able to find me in the [Molecular Information Systems Lab (MISL)](https://misl.cs.washington.edu/) or the [Synthetic Biology Lab](https://www.seeliglab.org/).

I previously worked in hardware development at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/), and I am passionate about youth education.  Please reach out if you share these interests or want to learn more!
