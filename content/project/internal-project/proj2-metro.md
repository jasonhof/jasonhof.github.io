In collaboration with the Molecular Information Systems Lab (MISL), the Synthetic Biology Lab, and Microsoft, I am investigating new ways to detect viral presence in urban infrastructure.

This project is supported by the [Microsoft Pandemic Preparedness Grant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/collaboration/studies-in-pandemic-preparedness/) and the [UW Population Health Economic Recovery Research Grants](https://www.washington.edu/populationhealth/2020/06/16/initiative-announces-award-of-18-covid-19-economic-recovery-grants/).  Thanks for the support!

More details to come - stay tuned!
